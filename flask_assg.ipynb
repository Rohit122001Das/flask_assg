    "   web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a\n",
    "   microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or \n",
    "   such features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It does have many cool features like url routing, template engine. \n",
    "     It is a WSGI web app framework.'''\n",

    "     Advantage of flash framework\n",
    "\n",
    "   1> Scalable:\n",
    "               Size is everything, and Flask’s status as a microframework means that you can use it to \n",
    "               grow a tech project such as a web app incredibly quickly. If you want to make an app that \n",
    "                starts small, but has the potential to grow quickly and in directions you haven’t completely\n",
    "                worked out yet, then it’s an ideal choice. Its simplicity of use and few dependencies enable \n",
    "                it to run smoothly even as it scales up and up.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2> Flexible :\n",
    "            This is the core feature of Flask, and one of its biggest advantages. To paraphrase one of the \n",

    "     3>Easy to negotiate :\n",
    "                   Like Django, being able to find your way around easily is key for allowing web developers to \n",
    "                   concentrate on just coding quickly, without getting bogged down. At its core, the microframework \n",
    "                   is easy to understand for web developers, not just saving them time and effort but also giving them \n",
    "                    more control over their code and what is possible.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "     4> Lightweight :\n",
    "                When we use this term in relation to a tool or framework, we’re talking about the design of it—there\n",
    "                are few constituent parts that need to be assembled and reassembled, and it doesn’t rely on a large \n",
    "                number of extensions to function. This design gives web developers a certain level of control."
